## Intro
xTensions is a collection of useful class extensions for UIKit. 

## Swift Package Manager

_Note: Instructions below are for using **SwiftPM** without the Xcode UI. It's the easiest to go to 
your Project Settings -> Swift Packages and add it from there._

To integrate using Apple's Swift package manager, without Xcode integration, add the following as
a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/garrefa/xTensions.git")
```

and then specify `"xTensions"` as a dependency of the Target in which you wish to use it.
